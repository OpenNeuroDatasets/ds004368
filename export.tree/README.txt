The study was approved by the ethical committee Sud Méditérannée II (217 R01). Twenty individuals with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder (schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, 16 males, 4 females) and 22 healthy participants (15 males, 7 females) from the general population took part in this study. Schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders were diagnosed based on the Structured Clinical Interview for assessing the DSM-5 criteria. The control group was screened for current or past psychiatric illness, and individuals were excluded if they met the criteria for a severe and persistent mental disorder.
We used a visual discrimination task. Stimuli consisted of 100 moving dots within a circle (3° radius) at the center of the screen. On each trial, participants indicated whether the motion direction of the dots was to the left or to the right by reaching and clicking on one of two choice targets (3° radius circle) at the top corners of the screen with a mouse. After 6 seconds without response, a buzz sound rang and a message was displayed inviting the participant to respond quicker. Motion coherence was adapted at the individual level via a 1up/2down staircase procedure in order to match task-performance between groups. Following each perceptual decision, participants were asked to report their confidence about their response using a vertical visual analog scale from 0% (Sure incorrect) to 100% (Sure correct), with 50% confidence meaning “Not sure at all”.
